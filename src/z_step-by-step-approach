# first steps
Set up React Router for our app.

1. Click on the words "Pic Some" in the header to go to the "/" route,
 which should display the Photos component (found in the pages folder)

2. Click on the shopping cart icon in the header to go to the "/cart" 
route, which should display the Cart component (found in the pages folder)

# second steps
Set up the Context for our app.

1. In a new file, create a new context with React
2. Create a custom component that renders the 
Provider of the context you created
3. Pass in an empty string "" as the context provider's 
value prop
4. Export the custom Provider component and the full context object 
(so we can pass it to the useContext hook eventually)
5. Set up index.js to use the custom context Provider created.
 (wrap it as a parent of the Router component)
